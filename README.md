## Road Map and Functionalities

### Load an external URL

- The simplest version possible is now implemented: you just need to load the main page with a `?this=URL` attribute to the URL.

### Parse document with [mozilla/Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability)

- This is being done by default now. Maybe we need a configuration to say we need the full page?

### Add web annotation

- TODO

### Export page to HTML file

- TODO

### Save web annotation separately

- TODO
